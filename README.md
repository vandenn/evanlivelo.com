Welcome to my personal website! For this iteration, I implemented the website in Next.js with Tailwind CSS.

# Setup

`cd` into your local copy of the repository and install dependencies:

```bash
cd evanlivelo.com
npm install
```

Then run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

## Optional: Clarity

This website integrates with [Microsoft's hosted Clarity solution](https://clarity.microsoft.com). To set that up in this repo, you'll need to have your Clarity project ID added to an `.env.local` file:

```bash
cp -i .env.example .env.local
```
