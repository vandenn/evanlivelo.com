## Welcome!

Welcome to my blog! _This is primarily a page to test out and make sure the Markdown features look right on my page_ when they're rendered dynamically by [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/), but I'll also use this opportunity to quickly talk a bit about what I want to do here.

## What to expect

I want to use this space as more of an outlet to put my thoughts to words, and a way to quickly share those words with other people. I've also done a lot of experiments in the past, and I realized that I've never really found a nice place to document them apart from stuffing the code into a repository and adding a `README`.

```bash
cd project_repo
cat README.md
```

**With this blog:**

- I'll be able to share my thoughts and ideas about different topics I encounter in my day-to-day, both work and non-work; and
- I'll have a place to put down project notes that don't quite fit in `README`s, like learnings, struggles, and realizations

_Here's a random diagram to test displaying images._

## Cheers!

See you in my [future blog posts](/blog)!
