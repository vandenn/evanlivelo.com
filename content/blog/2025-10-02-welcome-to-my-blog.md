Welcome to my blog! I'm excited to finally have a space to share my thoughts and experiences.

## What to Expect

I plan to write about:

- **Machine Learning & AI**: Technical deep-dives, project learnings, and industry observations
- **Software Engineering**: Best practices, architecture patterns, and development workflows
- **Career & Growth**: Lessons from leading teams and managing technical projects
- **Personal Projects**: Side projects, experiments, and creative endeavors

## Why Now?

After years of working on exciting ML and engineering projects, I've accumulated a lot of knowledge and experiences worth sharing. This blog is my way of giving back to the community and documenting my journey.

Stay tuned for more posts!
