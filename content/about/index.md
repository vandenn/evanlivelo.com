I'm Evan! I'm a **senior machine learning consultant lead**, **GenAI technical leader**, **data engineer**, and **fullstack software developer**.

In the realm of **ML**, I specialize in the fields of natural language processing, computer vision, deep learning, and generative AI, with research papers published in **two Scopus-indexed conferences**.

For **GenAI**, I've spearheaded flagship solutions, including a RAG-powered coaching system and LLM-powered executive toolsets with concrete business impact. I helped establish Thinking Machines as **OpenAI's first APAC partner** and co-authored the company's whitepaper on model evaluation frameworks for enterprise GenAI applictions.

On the **engineering** side of things, I've led the design and implementation of several robust backend solutions, databases, and microservice architectures for major clients globally. I've worked with a lot of different technologies over the years (and I'm studying more!), but I've spent a lot of my time with Python, Javascript, and C#, and I've had experience with a ton of various libraries including LangChain, PyTorch, TensorFlow+Keras, FastAPI, React+Redux, and more. I also deal with DevOps, cloud computing, and deployment jobs involving continuous integration with Docker, Kubernetes, Jenkins, and Gitlab CI to major cloud platforms including GCP, AWS, and Azure. In fact, some time back, I also got certified as a **Google Cloud Platform Professional Cloud Architect**!

I also work in **business development**, leading the technical scoping and strategic exploration of ML and data platform projects with clients in multiple verticals, including logistics, capital-heavy industries, manufacturing, and financial services. I work with cross-functional teams and senior leadership to push business development initiatives, develop architecture diagrams and solution proposals, strategize market penetration, and understand client pain points.

I'm a full-fledged **team lead, technical mentor, and people manager**, supporting and developing the careers of more than 10 engineers and developers across Philippines and Thailand, both junior and senior. I also work with fellow leads to push for process improvements to scale our operations and hiring.

Outside of work, I'm also a board game enthusiast (eurogames!), a home cook, a coffee brewing novice, a graphic designer, and a weeb looking to get proficient in Japanese (よろしくお願いします！).
