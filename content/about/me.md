I'm a senior machine learning consultant lead and GenAI technical leader at [Thinking Machines](thinkingmachin.es). I'm also a data engineer, a cloud architect, a fullstack software developer, a researcher, and an engineering manager. _(I'm also sometimes a [game developer](/projects)!)_

I also love playing board games (my gateway recommendation: [Cartographers](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/263918/cartographers)) _and_ video games (proudly 100% completion in [Hollow Knight: Silksong](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1030300/Hollow_Knight_Silksong/)), and I study every day to get proficient in my third language, Japanese.
