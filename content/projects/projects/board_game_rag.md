I wanted to make an end-to-end RAG application for myself, also as a reference repository for when I want to quickly start on other RAG-dependent projects. This repository was a way for me to consolidate a quick Streamlit frontend, a LangChain-enabled backend, Dagster pipelines, and a Weaviate vector DB backing.

Some of the code here is over-engineered for what it is, but I find it easier to just remove stuff I don't need. Most importantly, it's a great way for me to quickly ask a board game rules question without having to scour BoardGameGeek forums for edge cases while I'm playing.
