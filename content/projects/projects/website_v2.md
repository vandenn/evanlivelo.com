It's this site!

I was toying around with the idea of having a place to share my thoughts and ideas, and my existing website design didn't really support that, at least, not without significant changes. So I took the opportunity to revamp my website and add [my own tiny corner](/blog) where I can share those thoughts and ideas. It was also a good refresher on frontend development, particularly with this more modern stack compared to my v1 website.
