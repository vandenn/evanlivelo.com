A GenAI-powered learning application that helps you learn faster through AI-powered note-taking, RAG-based question answering, and pedagogical agents for reviewing. It's like Cursor for learning, or an open-source NotebookLM.

I learn a lot of new things regularly, and though I find a lot of tools like Obsidian and Claude Desktop quite helpful, I've always wanted to try building my own GenAI-powered application that I can personally use to accelerate my learning curve. This is that application.
